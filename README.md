# travelweb
I loved building this website. I wanted to make it responsive to have the best user interface for all users on every device. 
It worked pretty well. I have worked with different types of code and resources to make this website the best it can be. I believe
that there is always room for improvement, and I will take this to only grow and learn more.

The challenge that I had with this was the grid. I wanted to play with the grid tool a bit to become familar with it. 
But in the end, it worked pretty well. This website is a website that showcases a place that I would visit.
